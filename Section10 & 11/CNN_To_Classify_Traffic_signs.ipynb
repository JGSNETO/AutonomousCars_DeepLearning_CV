    "\n",
    "- Pooling or down sampling layers are places after convolutional layers to reduce feature map dimensionality.\n",
    "- This improves the computational efficiency while preserving the features.\n",
    "- Pooling helps the model to generalize by avoiding overfitting. If one of the pixel is shifted, the pooled feature map will still be the same.\n",
    "- Mox pooling works by retaining the maximum feature response within a given sample size in a feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Increase filters/droupout\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve accuracy by adding more feature detectors/filters or adding a droupout.\n",
    "- Dropout refers to dropping out units in a neural network.\n",
    "- Neurons develop co-dependency amongst each other during training.\n",
    "- Dropout is a regularization technique for reducing overfitting in neural networks.\n",
    "- It enables training to occur on several architectures of the neural network."
