    "- Cameras: Provides detailed images but require machine-learning algorithms to interpret 2D images. \n",
    "- LIDAR(Light Detection and Ranging): Works like radar, but instead of sending radio waves it emits infrared laser beams to measure how long they take to come back. Created a 3D map of the world in real time.\n",

    "- Any other colour can be created by mixing several intensities of RGB. \n",
    "- Each RGB pixel has three sets of 8-bit binary numbers which in turn translate into 24 bits of computer information in total.\n",
    "- Assuming same number of pixels, RGB image is three times bigger in file size than greysclale one. "
