    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image features are important areas an image that are unique to a specific image.\n",
    "- A feature is a piece of information in the image such as points, edges or objects that is different/unique.\n",
    "- A feature may be a color or a detected edge.\n",
    "- A good feature has to be repeatable: If feature can be detected in two or more different images of the same scene.\n",

    "## Why are features important ?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image Features are critical in machine learning and self-driving cars because they can be used to analyze, describe and match images.\n",
    "- Features can be used to train a classifier to detet objects such as pedestrians and cars. "
